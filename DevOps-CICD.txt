DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Project Overview :-

Project Title: Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Maven, Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes

Project Description :-

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline implementation using modern DevOps tools like GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Docker, Ansible, Docker Hub, and Kubernetes. The pipeline automates the entire process of code integration, testing, containerization, and deployment to a Kubernetes cluster. The end goal of this project is to ensure a reliable, scalable, and automated deployment of applications, enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

Project Architecture :-

1. Source Control (Git & GitHub):
    The source code is hosted on GitHub. Developers can push their changes to the GitHub      
    repository, which triggers the CI pipeline automatically.

2. Continuous Integration (Jenkins & Maven):
    Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub, builds the application using Maven, runs unit 
    tests, and packages the application into deployable artifacts (JAR). Jenkins also 
    generates a Docker image for the application.

3. Containerization (Docker & Docker Hub):
    A Dockerfile is used to package the application into a Docker container. The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub for version control and reusability.

4. Configuration Management & Deployment (Ansible & Kubernetes):
    Ansible is used to automate the deployment of the Docker image. It pulls the image from Docker Hub and deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring the application 
    runs in an orchestrated environment with load balancing and scaling.

Tools & Technologies Used :-

      * Git & GitHub: Source code management and version control.
      * Jenkins: Automation server for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
      * Maven: Build tool to manage dependencies and package the application.
      * Docker & Docker Hub: Containerization of the application to ensure consistency across environments.
      * Ansible: Configuration management and automation tool for deploying Docker containers.
      * Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform for managing, scaling, and deploying containerized applications.


Key Features of the Project :-

      * Automated CI/CD Pipeline: Fully automated process from code commit to deployment with Jenkins, Maven, Docker, and Kubernetes.
      * Containerization with Docker: Packaging the application and its dependencies into a Docker container ensures consistency across development, testing, and 
                                      production environments.
      * Version Control with GitHub & Docker Hub: Ensures traceability of code changes and Docker images.
      * Deployment with Ansible & Kubernetes: Ansible automates the deployment of the application into Kubernetes, 
                                              managing the scaling and load balancing of containerized applications.
      * Scalability: Kubernetes ensures the application can scale horizontally as needed, distributing traffic across multiple containers.


Project Workflow: Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. Code Development & Version Control (Git & GitHub)
      * Write Code:
                   Developers write code in their local development environment. The project could involve writing code in languages like Java, Python, etc.,  
                   depending on the application’s requirements.

      * Commit & Push to GitHub:
                                Once the developer has made changes, they use Git to track changes. Each set of changes is committed with a meaningful message. 
                                After committing, the code is pushed to a remote repository hosted on GitHub.

 Trigger:
         * Pushing the code to GitHub initiates the automated CI pipeline via a Webhook integration with Jenkins.

2. Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins

         * Pull Code from GitHub:
                                Jenkins is set up to automatically pull the latest code from GitHub whenever a new commit is detected. It listens for changes in the GitHub 
                                 repository and triggers a build process once new code is available.

         * Build Code with Maven:
                                 Jenkins uses Maven as the build tool to compile the source code and manage project dependencies. 
                                 The pom.xml file defines the dependencies, plugins, and build configurations. During this phase:
                                       * Code is compiled.
                                       * Unit tests are run.
                                       * The application is packaged into a JAR (Java Archive), making it ready for deployment.
                                       * Test Execution:
                                                       Unit tests and integration tests, if defined, are executed as part of the Maven build process. 
                                                       This ensures that the new code changes don’t break the application.

               Outcome:
                      * If the build is successful, Jenkins moves on to the next phase. If there are build failures or failing tests, 
                        the pipeline halts, and the developer is notified.

3. Containerization with Docker

               * Build Docker Image:
Jenkins uses a Dockerfile to package the application into a Docker image. The Docker image includes:
                  * The application (the JAR file built by Maven).
                  * Any necessary dependencies and configurations.
                  * The Dockerfile outlines the steps to set up the environment, install dependencies, and configure the application to run inside the container.
                  * Push Docker Image to Docker Hub:
Once the Docker image is built, it is tagged (versioned) and pushed to Docker Hub, a cloud-based registry for Docker images. Storing the image in Docker Hub ensures that it can be accessed and deployed later by other services (e.g., Kubernetes).


Key Action:
         * Jenkins handles authentication and pushes the image to the Docker Hub repository.
         * The image can be identified by its unique tag (e.g., your-dockerhub-username/your-app:latest).

4. Automated Deployment with Ansible
         * Configuration Management with Ansible:
                      Ansible is used to automate the deployment of the Docker image. Ansible playbooks (YAML scripts) 
                      define the steps required to deploy the containerized application to the desired environment.

Typical Ansible Playbook Steps:
            * Connect to the target environment (e.g., a cloud instance or a Kubernetes cluster).
            * Pull the latest Docker image from Docker Hub.
            * Configure environment variables or system settings (if required).
            * Deploy the Docker container to run the application.

      * Outcome:
            * Ansible ensures that the deployment process is consistent and repeatable. The automation helps reduce human errors and speeds up deployment.

5. Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

      * Pull Docker Image from Docker Hub:
                Kubernetes is configured to pull the Docker image from Docker Hub. The Kubernetes cluster pulls the image based on the deployment configuration.

      * Deployment Definition (Kubernetes YAML):
                The deploy.yaml file defines how the application should be deployed in the Kubernetes cluster. This includes:
                        * The number of replicas (instances) of the application to be deployed.
                        * The Docker image to use.
                        * Resource limits (CPU and memory) for the containers.
                        * Kubernetes ensures that the specified number of containers (replicas) are running at all times. 
                          If a container crashes, Kubernetes automatically restarts it.
                        * Service Configuration (Kubernetes YAML):

The service.yaml file defines how external traffic can access the application. A Kubernetes Service exposes 
the application to the outside world, typically through a LoadBalancer or ClusterIP.
                        * LoadBalancer: Directs traffic to different instances (pods) of the application.
                        * ClusterIP: Ensures internal communication between services within the Kubernetes cluster.
                        * Outcome:
                        * Kubernetes provides automatic scaling and load balancing, ensuring that the application remains highly available, even during traffic spikes.

Detailed Workflow Example

Here’s how the process would typically unfold:

      1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.

      2. Jenkins detects the code change and:
               * Pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.
               * Builds the code using Maven and runs tests.
               * Packages the application into a JAR/WAR file.

      3. Jenkins triggers the creation of a Docker image using a Dockerfile and:
               * Builds the Docker image with the application and its dependencies.
               * Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub for storage.

      4. Ansible automates the deployment:
               * Pulls the Docker image from Docker Hub.
               * Deploys the Docker container to the target infrastructure.

      5. Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment:
               * Pulls the Docker image into a Kubernetes cluster.
               * Deploys the application based on the defined replica count.
               * Configures services to expose the application to external users.
               * Monitors and manages the application’s health, scaling, and load balancing.
